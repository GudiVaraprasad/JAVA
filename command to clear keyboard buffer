/*In this program we are reading an Integer in line 7 , after reading an Integer user press the Enter Key 
but the scanner class keeps the Enter Key unread in the keyboard buffer same will happen in line 8 with nextDouble 
and when its time to supply String to the nextLine(),, it will read the enter key from the user thinking that the user 
has entered the enter key.(that's why we get empty output if we donâ€™t use line 9).*/
